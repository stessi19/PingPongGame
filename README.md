# Ping Pong Game

**Overview:**
This Python project presents a classic Ping Pong arcade game implemented with simplicity and fun in mind. Players control paddles to intercept a bouncing ball. The objective is to prevent the ball from hitting your side of the wall; failing to do so results in conceding a point to your opponent. The project serves as an entertaining coding exercise and an excellent introduction to game development in Python.

**Features:**
- Utilizes Python's built-in Turtle module for graphical elements.
- Interactive gameplay where players move paddles to prevent the ball from hitting their side of the wall.
- Scoring system tracks your points, adding a competitive element to the game.

**How to Play:**
1. Run the Python script to initiate the game.
2. Control your paddle using designated keys(To move the right paddle, use "Up" and "Down" keys and to move the left paddle, use "w" to move the paddle up and "s" to move it downwards) to intercept the ball.
3. Aim to prevent the ball from reaching your side to accumulate points.
